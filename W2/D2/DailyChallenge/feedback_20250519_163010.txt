suggestions for improvement:
- The `__str__` method can be simplified and made more robust.
- Add input validation to the `page_size` parameter in the constructor to handle non-positive values.
- The test cases should be more comprehensive, including edge cases like empty lists and page sizes larger than the number of items.
- Improve error messages for better user experience, for example, instead of  'There is no next page.' write 'You are currently on the last page.'
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code largely fulfills the requirements.  The `Pagination` class correctly implements pagination with methods for navigation.  The `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, and `previous_page` methods work as expected.  The `__str__` method is functional but could be improved. The `ValueError` exceptions are correctly raised for out-of-bounds page numbers.  There is a minor discrepancy with the provided test case `p.go_to_page(10)` which should raise a `ValueError` and not print 7 as stated in the test instructions. This is because the test instructions have a mistake in them.  The rest of the functionality aligns well with the chapter content.
- readability: The code is generally readable.  Method names are descriptive. The code could benefit from slightly more concise `__str__` implementation and more comments explaining complex logic within navigation methods.
- performance: The performance is good. The algorithm for pagination is efficient, using list slicing for `get_visible_items`. The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of items, which is reasonable for this task.
- security: The code is secure. It handles potential errors (like out-of-bounds page numbers) by raising `ValueError` exceptions, preventing unexpected behavior. No security vulnerabilities are apparent.
