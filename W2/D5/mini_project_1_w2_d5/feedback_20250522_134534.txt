suggestions for improvement:
- The `get_anagrams` method should return an empty list instead of the string 'No anagrams found' when no anagrams are found. This aligns better with the instructions to return a list.
- The `AnagramChecker` class should handle potential exceptions (like `FileNotFoundError`) during file loading in the `__init__` method.
- The performance of `get_anagrams` could be improved by using more efficient algorithms.  Currently, it iterates through the entire word list for every anagram search.
- Add input validation to `get_anagrams` to handle non-string inputs or empty strings gracefully.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `AnagramChecker` class is not fully implemented in the provided code snippet.  The code only shows the UI interaction and input validation, but the core logic of the `AnagramChecker` class (loading the word list, checking word validity, and finding anagrams) is missing.
- The program does not handle the case where a valid word has no anagrams. It should gracefully handle this scenario, for example, by stating 'No anagrams found'.
- Error handling could be improved. Instead of simply printing error messages, consider using exceptions for more robust error management.
- The `valid_input` function could be made more concise.  For example, chaining conditions could streamline the logic.
- The performance can be improved by optimizing the anagram search algorithm.  Currently, it likely uses a brute-force approach, which is inefficient for larger word lists. Consider using more efficient algorithms such as sorting characters and comparing.
