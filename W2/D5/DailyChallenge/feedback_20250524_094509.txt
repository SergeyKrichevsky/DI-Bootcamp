suggestions for improvement:
- The `deal` method uses `random.randint` to select a card, which is inefficient for dealing cards sequentially.  A better approach would be to use `pop()` to remove cards from the beginning or end of the deck.
- The `Card` class is missing, as specified in the instructions. The code only creates cards implicitly within the `Deck` class.
- Error handling should be added to the `deal` method to handle the case where the deck is empty.
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the `value` attribute (e.g., `ranks`).
